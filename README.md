|   | Name                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|---|:---------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | [Intruder Photo](/macros/Intruder_Photo.macro)           | Take photo if phone unlock fails and send SMS.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2 | [Battery Monitor](/macros/Battery_Monitor.macro)         | Voice alarm for battery low/full status. I made it for my ageing mother as she has difficulty with reading, it can be used by anyone who struggles with using a phone.                                                                |
| 3 | [Auto GPS OFF](/macros/Auto_GPS_OFF.macro)               | Auto switch off GPS after a timeout on launching user specified apps. I made it to prevent unnecessary battery drain by certain apps (like WFH check-in apps) that require GPS only briefly but leave it turned on in the background. |
| 4 | [Developer Options](/macros/Developer_Options.macro)     | Widget to launch developer options setting and also show on/off status indicator. It can be very useful for Android Developers.                                                                                                       |
| 5 | [Battery Temperature](/macros/Battery_Temperature.macro) | Widget to display the current battery temperature with overheating/normal status indicator. It can be very useful for those who work in hot environments.                                                                             |
